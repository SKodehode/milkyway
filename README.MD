# Weight Converter

For this project I made a weight converter as a part of an assignment we were tasked with working on during our summer vacation. 

And since we had 3 weeks to work on it, it was larger than any of our previous assignments. And it served to test our skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

We were given a list of the planets in our solar system together with each planet's different gravitational value. And we were going to use this in order to make a weight converter letting the users convert their weight in kilos on earth to that of another planet. It was a fun project to work on and it was nice to get to work with all the knowledge I've gained so far during this coding course.
